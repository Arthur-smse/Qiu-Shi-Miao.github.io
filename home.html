  <p>My name is Qiu-Shi Miao. I am currently an undergruaduate student majoring in Materials Science and Engineering with a second major in Computer Science from Shanghai Jiao Tong University-SJTU in China.</p>

  <p>Different from many others, I chose to stay one more year in SJTU before the application for Ph.D in 2019. It is not about fair for failness, but about puzzle for whether I could shoulder the responsibility of discovering the essence of the nature, with keeping feeling curious and happy on the way of research. After spending one more year to unload the pressure and think peacefully, I think I shall insist applying for Ph.D in Materials Science. As I think that I sort of figure out how to balence between reasearch and life. I could be active to find the points that could please me in the reseach now, and I hope I could always stay as a curious and cute child in front of science.  </p>

  <!--<p>I have published one conference paper (<a href="pub/icdm15-lambdaMF.pdf">pdf</a>) in the <b><i>Proceedings of the 2015 IEEE International Conference on Data Mining</i></b> (ICDM). Due to my outstanding performance when interning at Intel Labs in June-September 2015, Intel filed <b>4 international patent applications</b> on my behalf; During my junior and senior years of study, I participated in several competitions and fortunately received <b>12th Place</b> at KDD Cup 2014, <b>Excellent Performance Award</b> at TSMC Big Data Competition, the biggest annual data mining competition in Taiwan, in 2014, and 2 <b>First Place</b> and 1 <b>Second Place</b> at the Undergraduate Research Project Exhibition Awards co-organized by NTU CSIE, Appier Inc., and Delta Inc. in 2015.</p>

  After I joined Prof. Yun-Nung (Vivian) Chen's lab in Oct. 2016, I started to conduct research on Natural Language Processing. Especially, I work on multi-sense word representations problems, where-->
