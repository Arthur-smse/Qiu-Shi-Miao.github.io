  <p>My name is Qiu-Shi Miao. I am currently an undergruaduate student majoring in Materials Science and Engineering with a second major in Computer Science from Shanghai Jiao Tong University-SJTU in China.</p>

  <p>My research interests currently focus on small molecules electrochemistry, as HER,OER,CO2RR and NRR. In my undergraduate period, I did some research on the design of the self-supported electrocalysts, with an emphasis on the nanoarray design. I think the self-supported catalysts have a brighter potential to be applied in the future, based on the functionality and geometry factors. In this period, I find the significance of the research in clean energy, and I think I would be interested in research related with battery design and electrochemistry. Besides, I got familiar with electrochemistry test, and common chemical synthesis method, and mastered the primary skills to do research independently. </p>

  <!--<p>I have published one conference paper (<a href="pub/icdm15-lambdaMF.pdf">pdf</a>) in the <b><i>Proceedings of the 2015 IEEE International Conference on Data Mining</i></b> (ICDM). Due to my outstanding performance when interning at Intel Labs in June-September 2015, Intel filed <b>4 international patent applications</b> on my behalf; During my junior and senior years of study, I participated in several competitions and fortunately received <b>12th Place</b> at KDD Cup 2014, <b>Excellent Performance Award</b> at TSMC Big Data Competition, the biggest annual data mining competition in Taiwan, in 2014, and 2 <b>First Place</b> and 1 <b>Second Place</b> at the Undergraduate Research Project Exhibition Awards co-organized by NTU CSIE, Appier Inc., and Delta Inc. in 2015.</p>

  After I joined Prof. Yun-Nung (Vivian) Chen's lab in Oct. 2016, I started to conduct research on Natural Language Processing. Especially, I work on multi-sense word representations problems, where-->
