    <h3>Chinese Calligraphy</h3>
    <p>I practiced Chinese calligraphy for 7 years since I was 9 years old. I am able to write in various kinds of styles in Chinese calligraphy, including Small Seal Script, Clerical Script, Regular Script, Semi-cursive Script, and Cursive Script. I love the delicate balance in the character structure and the drastic contrast in the writing intensity in Chinese calligraphy. The left picture is taken from my awarded work (2nd place) from the calligraphy competition in my junior high school. For the details in my work please refer to the full picture by clicking the left picture.</p>
