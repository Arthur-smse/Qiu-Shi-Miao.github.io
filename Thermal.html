            <h3>Solar Cell Photonic Cooler Design with 1D and 2D Combined Photonic Crystals via Passband Broadening</h3>

            <p>
                The control of the temperature of solar cells has a significant impact on its efficiency and reliability. In this work, we propose a new photonic cooler design for solar cells, by simultaneously reducing the absorption of the impractical sunlight and enhancing the thermal radiation of solar cells. The photonic cooler combines a 1D photonic crystal and a 2D photonic crystal, for both solar radiation reflection and radiative cooling. The 2D photonic crystal fill the undesired gap of 1D photonic crystal by changing the incident wave vector, thus broadening the passband. The optical performance and cooling effect of the photonic cooler are theoretically analyzed, showing a 2.9K temperature decrease on mid-IR absorptive solar cells, and 10.1K temperature decrease on mid-IR transparent solar cells. The thickness of our photonic cooler could be obviously reduced, and the design process could be simplified. We further demonstrate our approach as a general approach for designing solar cell photonic coolers. This work predicts a new photonic design scheme for the thermal management of solar cells.
